# Will's Wacky website - static version
## Personal website for fork testing

I've forked Will's repo and made the following adjustments:

* Added my own (profile) picture to the forked repo
* Changed the profile picture in the HTML
* Changed and added some text

I've also put it [online](https://vincentsijben.github.io/will-wacky-website/).
